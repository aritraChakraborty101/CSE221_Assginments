# Task 2:
# Here is the code of bubble sort. Its run time complexity is θ(n
# 2
# ). Change the code in a
#
# way so that its time complexity is θ(n) for the best-case scenario.
# You have to explain how you have achieved the θ(n) for the best-case scenario in a
# comment block of your code.
# def bubbleSort(arr):
# for i in range(len(arr)-1):
# for j in range(len(arr)-i-1):
# if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
# arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
#
# Input 1:
# 5
# 3 2 1 4 5
#
# Output 1:
# 1 2 3 4 5
#
# Input 2:
# 6
# 5 10 15 20 25 30
#
# Output 2:
# 5 10 15 20 25 30
#
# For the input 2, your code should run at θ(n).

# when it finds the next item smaller than the previous one. From this
# operation we can come to a conclusion. That is, if for an entire n length
# it does not find any item that bigger than its previous one , it will not perform any swap
# So, we can keep track of those swaps with a boolean variable then if it does not perform any swaps
# for an entire loop the code will terminate itself.
# In the best case if the input array is already sorted then the loop will terminate
# after n operation
