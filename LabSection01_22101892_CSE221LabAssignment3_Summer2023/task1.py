# Somewhere in the universe, the Biannual Regional Alien
# Competition is taking place.
# There are N aliens standing in a line. You will be given a
# permutation of N, which denotes the height of each alien. A
# sequence of N numbers is called permutation if it contains all
# integers from 1 to N exactly once. For example, the sequences
# [3,1,4,2], [1] and [2,1] are permutations, but [1,2,1], [0,1]
# and [1,3,4] — are not.
# In the competition, for each alien, the judge wants to count how
# many aliens are standing on its right side with a strictly
#
# smaller height. The judge writes the following code to solve the
# problem.
#
# count = 0
# for i in range(n):
# for j in range(i+1,n):
# if H[i] > H[j]:
# count+=1
#
# However, their algorithm wasn’t efficient at all. Hence, the
# alien calls you to write a better solution for the program.
# More formally, you have to count how many pairs of aliens are
# standing in the line such that H[i] > H[j] and i<j. Here, A is
# the permutations of Alience’s height. And i,j denotes the
# Alience’s position.
#
# Input
# The first line contains a single integer 1 <= N <= 106 - the
# number of total aliens.
# The next line contains N integers H1,H2,............,Hn(1 ≤ Hi ≤ N)- the
# height of the i-th alien. It is guaranteed that the given heights will
# be the permutation of N.
#
# Output
# Print a single integer, which denotes the total number of
# inversions of the given permutation of alien’s heights as
# described in the problem statement.
