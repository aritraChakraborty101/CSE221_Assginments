# The idea is to store the results of the problems so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.
# Instead of recursion, we can also solve the above problem iteratively. The idea is similar, we only need to store
# the last two results of the problems and compute the result of the current problem. This can be easily done
# by storing the last two results in two variables and updating them for each iteration.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
